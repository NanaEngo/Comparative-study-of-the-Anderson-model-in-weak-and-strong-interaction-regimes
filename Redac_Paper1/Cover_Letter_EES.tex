\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, \textbf{``Spectral Bath Engineering for Quantum-Enhanced Agrivoltaics: Advancing Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability via Non-Markovian Dynamics,''} for consideration as an original research article in \textit{Energy \& Environmental Science}.

\textbf{Significance and novelty}

This work addresses a critical challenge at the energy-environment nexus: optimizing agrivoltaic systems that co-locate solar energy generation with agricultural production to enhance both clean energy output and food security. While conventional agrivoltaic designs treat light as a classical photon flux, we demonstrate that accounting for quantum mechanical aspects of photosynthetic energy transfer can deliver significant improvements in both energy and agricultural productivity. Our framework of \textit{quantum spectral bath engineering} leverages non-Markovian quantum coherence effects to optimize the spectral quality of light reaching crops.

Key findings of this study include:

\textbf{(1) Quantifiable quantum advantages for energy and environment.} We demonstrate that strategic spectral filtering through semi-transparent organic photovoltaic (OPV) panels can enhance the photosynthetic electron transport rate by \SI{25}{\percent} via vibronic resonance-assisted transport. These quantum advantages persist under realistic environmental conditions, with pairwise concurrence nearly doubling (\SI{+89}{\percent}) and linear entropy decreasing by \SI{38}{\percent}. This translates to improved agricultural productivity while maintaining \SIrange{15}{18}{\percent} power conversion efficiency, directly addressing the energy-food nexus.

\textbf{(2) Rigorous computational validation with environmental relevance.} Our comprehensive framework achieved \SI{100}{\percent} success across 12 independent numerical tests, including benchmarking against numerically exact methods and robustness checks under physiological conditions and static disorder typical of biological systems. Geographic simulations across nine climate zones—including five sub-Saharan African sites—confirm persistent quantum advantages of \SIrange{18}{26}{\percent}, demonstrating global environmental applicability and particular relevance to food security in regions where energy and agricultural productivity improvements are most needed.

\textbf{(3) Sustainable materials design principles.} Using eco-design analysis with quantum reactivity descriptors, we identify OPV materials with optimized biodegradability indices ($B_{\rm index} = 72$ for PM6 derivative, $B_{\rm index} = 58$ for Y6-BO derivative) that achieve \SIrange{15}{18}{\percent} PCE with \SIrange{15}{20}{\percent} ETR enhancement. This addresses the environmental sustainability aspect critical to EES, ensuring end-of-life compatibility with ecosystems.

\textbf{(4) Quantitative design specifications for practical implementation.} Using Pareto frontier analysis, we establish precise engineering specifications for next-generation OPV materials—dual-band transmission at \SIlist{750;820}{\nano\meter} with \SI{70}{\nano\meter} FWHM. These specifications balance electrical power conversion with biological energy transfer enhancement, providing actionable targets for materials scientists working on sustainable energy technologies.

\textbf{(5) Experimental verification and deployment readiness.} We provide specific, testable predictions for validation using existing ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, with potential for immediate field trials. This bridges the fundamental quantum science with practical energy and environmental applications.

\textbf{Alignment with EES scope and mission}

This manuscript directly addresses the core mission of \textit{Energy \& Environmental Science} by advancing sustainable energy technologies with clear environmental benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sustainable energy systems.} Our quantum-enhanced agrivoltaics contribute to sustainable land use by maximizing both energy and food output per unit area, directly addressing UN SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG 2 (Zero hunger). This is particularly relevant for sub-Saharan Africa and other regions facing food-energy nexus challenges.
    
    \item \textbf{Energy-environment nexus.} By demonstrating that quantum effects can enhance both energy conversion and biological productivity simultaneously, we address the critical interface between energy production and environmental impact, a core focus of EES.
    
    \item \textbf{Computational materials science.} We employ non-Markovian quantum dynamics methods (Process Tensor HOPS and Spectrally Bundled Dissipators) that offer significant computational advantages while maintaining accuracy, enabling modeling of complex energy conversion processes relevant to photosynthesis and solar energy.
    
    \item \textbf{Environmental sustainability.} Our eco-design framework using quantum reactivity descriptors ensures that the proposed technologies have minimal environmental impact at end-of-life, with biodegradable materials that support circular economy principles.
    
    \item \textbf{Global environmental applicability.} The demonstrated effectiveness across diverse climatic zones, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, addresses environmental science applications where they are most critically needed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Broader impact and future directions}

Beyond agrivoltaics, this study establishes a general methodology for quantum biomimetic engineering: identifying quantum-enhanced processes in natural systems and engineering artificial environments to maximize their efficiency. This approach has potential applications in artificial photosynthesis, quantum-dot solar cells, molecular electronics, and other sustainable energy technologies. The integration of quantum reactivity descriptors with eco-design principles provides a roadmap for environmentally sustainable quantum technologies.
