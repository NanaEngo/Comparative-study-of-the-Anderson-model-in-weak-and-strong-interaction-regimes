## Notes:
- Many DOIs may be valid but not accessible from the current server environment
- Some DOIs may have been updated or changed by the publishers
- The 70.8% success rate indicates that the majority of DOIs are valid
- Manual verification and correction may be needed for the invalid entries

## Recommendations:
1. Manually verify the validity of these DOIs using the publisher websites
2. Update the DOIs with the correct ones if available
3. Consider adding alternative identifiers (PMID, arXiv IDs) for papers with invalid DOIs
4. Regularly audit the bibliography for DOI validity
