# Refined Graphical Abstract Prompt (BMAD)

**Goal**: Generate a world-class graphical abstract for "Energy & Environmental Science" that visualizes the bridge between **Spectral Bath Engineering** and **Quantum-Enhanced Plant Growth**.

## The Refined Prompt

> **Core Objective**: Create a sleek, professional 3D scientific infographic visualizing "Spectral Bath Engineering for Quantum-Enhanced Agrivoltaics."
>
> **Visual Schema (Vertical Flow)**:
> 1. **Top (The Filter)**: A semi-transparent organic photovoltaic (OPV) roof (labeled "Quantum-Engineered OPV"). Show broadband sunlight hitting the top and being transformed into two distinct, glowing spectral bands (filtering for 750nm and 820nm). The OPV should have a modern "molecular lattice" texture (PM6/Y6-BO).
> 2. **Center (The Quantum Bridge)**: A microscopic cut-away showing a Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex. Visualize "Vibronic Resonance": glowing, oscillating energy levels where exciton waves (cyan) are synchronized with protein vibrations (vibrant purple). Show energy "funneling" efficiently toward a reaction center.
> 3. **Bottom (The Bio-Output)**: Lush, healthy agricultural crops (wheat/lettuce) thriving under the filtered light. Show a direct visual link (a glowing energy stream) from the filtered light to the quantum transport inside the plant cells.
> 4. **Key Metrics (Subtle overlays)**:
>    - Text bubble: "**+25% ETR** (Quantum Enhancement)"
>    - Text bubble: "**PCE: 18.8%**"
>    - Sustainability Icon: "**Eco-Design: 100% Biodegradable**"
>
> **Artistic Style**: 
> - **Genre**: Scientific illustration / Journal Cover Art.
> - **Lighting**: Cinematic, high-contrast, glowing energy effects against a sophisticated dark or clean white laboratory background.
> - **Vibe**: Premium, state-of-the-art, "The future of sustainable agriculture."
> - **Colors**: Deep turquoise, neon-green, and "resonance purple."
> - **Format**: High-detail 3D render, isometric perspective.

## BMAD Refinements
- **Brief**: Removed descriptive fillers; used "Visual Schema" for layout hierarchy.
- **Meaningful**: Explicitly named the vibronic resonance mechanism to guide the AI's internal "knowledge" of quantum biology.
- **Actionable**: Provided specific molecular labels (PM6/Y6-BO) and color codes (Resonance Purple/Cyan).
- **Direct**: Uses high-value aesthetic tags (Journal Cover Art, Cinematic Lighting).
